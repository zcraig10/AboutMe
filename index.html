 			<h1>Introduction</h1>	
			<p>I want to become a web/software developer. I really enjoy seeing this crazy looking code come to life on a page. I first decided I wanted to learn how to code a few years ago when I had these great ideas pop into my head, but I didn't know what to do with them. So I want to be able to develop them, and someday hopefully release them to the world, because I believe they are interesting and/or have the ability to impact a lot of people.</p>

 			<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
			<p>I'm from Indiana. It's not a bad place to live, but I need to move. Living near the ocean is really appealing to me.</p>
