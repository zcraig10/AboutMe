			<p>I want to become a web/software developer. I really enjoy seeing this crazy looking code come to life on a page. And it can be done from anywhere, so I can work and see the world at the same time.</p>	
			<p>I'm also soon going to get my scuba diving certification and am considering becoming an instructor so I can travel the world as a scuba diver. I find the world under the ocean fascinating and want to find sunken treasure.</p>

			<h1>Where I'm From</h1>
			<p>I'm from Indiana. It's not a bad place to live, but I need to move. Living near the ocean is really appealing to me.</p>
